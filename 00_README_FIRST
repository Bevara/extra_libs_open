I Overview
This package contains all libraries needed to build an almost complete complete version of GPAC version 0.4.5 and SVN versions.
To find out more about non included libraries in this package, please refer to GPAC install documentation.

See each package for License terms.

Windows Users:

All packages are configure to compile "out of the box" for Win32 VC8 and WinCE eVC4

If you wish to use different versions of these packages, you MUST update the headers included in the GPAC distribution (gpac/extra_lib/include/*) and copy 
the compiled libraries in the appropriate directory in the GPAC distribution (gpac/extra_lib/lib/$platform_build) where $platform_build is one of:
	* w32_deb: win32 platform, debug version (MSVC6 compiler)
	* w32_rel: win32 platform, release version (MSVC6 compiler)
	* arm_ppc03_deb: ARM PocketPC/Smartphone 2003 platform, debug version (MS eVC4 compiler)
	* arm_ppc03_rel: ARM PocketPC/Smartphone 2003 platform, release version (MS eVC4 compiler)

The simplest way is to copy the entire content of the build dir (eg gpac_extra_lib/lib/*) to the gpac lib dir (gpac/extra_lib/lib/)

GCC Users:

If you wish to use different versions of these packages and are not planing to install these packages on your system:
* you MUST update the headers included in the GPAC distribution (gpac/extra_lib/include/*) 
* you MUST copy the compiled lib in gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc in the GPAC distribution. Unlike for Windows the package files are not output in gpac_extra_lib/lib/gcc,  you will have to look for them...

FFMPEG fans:
No revision of FFMPEG is included, please check FFMPEG.org to get the binary distribution and corresponding headers. The latest stable release tested was FFMPEG 2.4.2

    - Check you have the following files in the lib/iOS directory: libfaad.a, libfreetype.a, libjpeg.a, libjs.a, libmad.a, libpng.a, libSDL.a

IV Compiling with GCC
	NOTES: 
	 *	As said above, the files are not output in gpac_extra_lib/lib/gcc you will have to look for them and copy them in gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc in the GPAC distribution
	 *	If you are not installing these libraries on your system and use shared version (.so, .dll), you MUST update your environment settings so that the shared libraries may be 
	found (usually LD_LIBRARY_PATH). As a general rule you'd better compile as static libs if you don't want to install the libs on your system. You may want to copy the shared 
	libraries to gpac/bin/gcc, but this is optional
	 * if you are installing the libraries on your system, just type 'make install' once each library is successfully compiled
	
	IV.1 Compiling faad2
			./bootstrap
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libfaad.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
	
	IV.2 Compiling FreeType
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libfreetype.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
			
	IV.3 Compiling JS
		* js under MinGW:
			cd js/fdmlib
			cp makefile.mingw Makefile
			make
			cd js/
			cp makefile.mingw makefile
			Make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy js/libjs.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc and js/js.dll to gpac/bin/gcc
			
		* js with other GCC build
			make -f Makefile.ref (cf js/Readme.html or WWW)
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy js/libjs.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc and js/js.so to gpac/bin/gcc
			
			NOTE: compilation may fail with GCC 4.1 - this is a known GCC bug. You will have to build JS in optimised mode:
			 export BUILD_OPT=1
			 make -f Makefile.ref
			
	IV.4 Compiling libjpg 
			./configure
			make
			NOTE1: you MUST copy the generated jconfig.h (except under MinGW) to gpac/extra_lib/include/jpeg if you're not installing the jpeg lib on the system
			NOTE2: this will erase the win32 config file (jconfig.h) for VC6 and EVC3, a backup file is provided (jconfig.win32) for later rebuild
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libjpeg.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

	IV.5 Compiling libpng
			get the right makefile in libpng/scripts/ and copy it to libpng/Makefile. For MinGW, use the makefile.cygwin file
			rm install
			make ZLIBINC=../zlib
			Note for MinGW users: don't bother about any ld errors, we only use libpng.a.
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libpng.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

	IV.6 Compiling libmad
			./configure
			make
			NOTE: this will erase the win32 config file (config.h) for VC6 and EVC3, a backup file is provided ( mad/msvc++/config.h and mad/msevc/config.h) for later rebuild
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libmad.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

	IV.7 Compiling xvidcore
			cd xvidcore/build/generic
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libxvidcore.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

	IV.8 Compiling zlib:
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libz.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

	IV.9 Compiling libopenjpeg:
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libopenjpeg.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

	IV.10 Compiling libogg
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libogg.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

	IV.11 Compiling libvorbis
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libvorbis.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

	IV.12 Compiling libtheora
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libtheora.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

V Compiling for symbian
    The set of extra lib have only been tested on symbian S60 3rd edition. You will need to get the symbian SDK from Nokia/Symbian/SE, 
    and verify it is properly setup.
    You may modify the compilation option of the SDK in files SDK\Epoc32\tools\compilation_config, especially removing C++ compil options 

    At prompt (win32 cmd.exe):
    cd gpac_extra_libs/build/symbian
    bldmake bldfiles
    abld build gcce urel
    
    This will build the following libraries: freetype, jpeg, js, mad, png, openjpeg. 
    faad library can be compiled by editing bld.inf file but is too slow to be used on symbian. GPAC uses symbian native AAC decoder
      if available
    Ogg/vorbis/theora are not available for GPAC on symbian yet.
